Part 1: Directions on setting up Git/Webstorm/Github

 Setting up Git
 
    Step 1:
    Use the following link to download the latest version of Git for your operating system type:
    https://git-scm.com/downloads
    
    Step 2:
    Go through the setup window, make sure you choose a folder location that is easy for you to find. For example on windows: C:\Program Files\Git
    
    Step 3:
    Make sure the following components are selected:
      Windows Explorer integration.
      Git LFS
      Associate .git* configuration files with the default text editor.
      Associate .sh files to be run with Bash.
      
    Step 4:
    Choose you defualt editor used by Git:
      I recommend using Wordpad as Git's default editor because Wordpad is already installed on your PC.
      
    Step 5:
    Passed this point, leave all other options on their default options and click install.
    
    Step 6:
    Configure your local GitHub installation with your GitHub credentials by using the following commands:
      git config –global user.name "github_username" 
      git config –global user.email "email_address"
      
  Setting up GitHub Desktop
  
    Step 1:
    Use the following link to download the latest version of GitHub desktop for your operating system:
      https://desktop.github.com/
    
    Step 2:
    Sign into your GitHub account and authorize GitHub desktop.
    
    You should see your recently created repositories under the Your Repositories List.
    
    Step 3: 
    Select your repository and clone it.
  
  Setting up WebStorm
  
    Step 1:
    Use the following link to download the latest version of WebStorm
    https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/
    
    Step 2:
    Go through the installation process with the default settings unchanged. WebStorm should automatically detect Git that was installed from the prior step.
    
    Step 3:
    Sign into your JetBrains account which should have a student license already. If it doesn't, get one.
